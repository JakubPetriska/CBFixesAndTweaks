# peppy-tweaks
Fix keyboard mapping in Linux on Chromebook Peppy.

## Mapping
* Shift + Backspace is mapped to Delete key.
* Some multimedia keys are mapped to their multimedia functions (in Linux they default to F keys). Original F key is emulated by using Ctrl + Alt + Multimedia key.

# How to use
Copy and paste these commands in a terminal window:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads; curl -LOk https://github.com/JakubPetriska/peppy-tweaks/archive/master.tar.gz; tar -zxvf master.tar.gz; cd peppy-tweaks-master; ./tweak.sh
```
